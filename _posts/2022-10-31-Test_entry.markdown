This is my first entry of the blog. I'm learning how to personalize these
post entries with markdown files. Looks like it's fairly easy to do, but
I would like to know better what you can do with these files, since I'm
more familiar with Wordpress type of entries.

Normally I would use some headings to categorize my text

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4

Use some ***bold text*** or hiperlinks to link [some other entries][Jekyll-welcome] or my
personal [social media][Linkedin] to improve the SEO kind of stuff.

I also use some code sometimes (TODO: check how to write python or C):


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
